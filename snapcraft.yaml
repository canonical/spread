summary: Convenient full-system test (task) distribution
description: |
    Spread is a plesant way distribute full-system integration tests and
    similar tasks. A few simple and concrete concepts that are fun to play
    with and fix the exact piece missing in the puzzle. It's not Jenkins,
    it's not Travis, it's not a library, not a language, and it's not even
    specific to testing. It's a simple way to express what to run and
    where, what to do before and after it runs, and how to duplicate jobs
    with minor variations without copy & paste.
